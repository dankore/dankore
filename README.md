### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught software engineer who specializes in responsive web designs. Since November 2018, I have been working part-time for my internet startup, Home Away From Home, as a Software Engineer and Head of Marketing. 

We grew the startup to 4,000 unique visits and 400,000 SSL requests a month.

I also tinker with designs. My Facebook Profile Frames have more than 13 million impressions and 231,674* shares.
